## Introduction
The Contact Management System is a project that can manage the contact details of a person you know. The system can help you organize a person details by entering their information such as Phone number, Name, etc. The purpose of the system is to help and maintain the managing of a person contact information.
## Research
The contact Management System was created in a simple console application, the system can be access without providing any login information. The user can do a lot of task in the system, he/she can add new contact, list all contact, search person detail, and delete person record. The system contains function that can manage the contact information being stored in the system. The user can update the current contact information. The entered data are stored as a text extension file in the system folder.
## Cost and Features and Timeline
File handling, functions and pointers are the main things which make up this project. The key features of contact management system are listed below:

1.Insert new contacts: with information such as name, phone number.     
2.Update contacts: edit information given while inserting the contacts – name, phone number.    
3.Delete contacts: deletes contacts from file.    
4.Display contacts: lists all the contacts stored in file with their respective contact details.    
5.Search contacts: based on name. 
## Defining our system
The Contact Management System is a very simple project that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling, and pointers. This program will teach you how to add, list, change or edit, search and remove data from/to a file. Adding new records, listing them, editing and updating them, looking for saved contacts, and removing contact records are simple Functions that make up the main menu of this system.
Personal information, such as name, phone number is requested when you add a record to your file. These records can then be updated, entered, searched, and deleted. I’ve used a lot of functions, And these functions are easy to understand since their name means just their respective operations. Therefore the main purpose of the system is to record and organize your contacts details within the software.
## SWOT Analysis
It is simple system for the user to store complete information (e.g. name, phone number) about his or her contact. It’s simple for the user to simply check his appropriate contact number by entering the contact name. The weakness would involve, the user can save the different phone number to the same person that could leads to confusion. The threat would involve, if the record was deleted from the saved file it would be permanently deleted. The oppurtunity would involve, the efficient way of maintain the managing of a person contact information.
